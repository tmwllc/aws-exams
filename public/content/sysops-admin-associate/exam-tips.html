        <li>Signed certificates</li>
        <li class="correct">Security Group memberships</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="more-info">You use different types of security credentials depending on how you interact with AWS. For example, you use a user name and password to sign in to the AWS Management Console. You use access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS API actions. Key pairs consist of a public key and a private key. You use the private key to create a digital signature, and then AWS uses the corresponding public key to validate the signature. You can create Amazon EC2 key pairs from the Amazon EC2 console, CLI, or API. Access keys consist of an access key ID and a secret access key. You use access keys to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS if you use the AWS SDKs, REST, or Query APIs. One can use the IAM API to upload a certificate, via the UploadServerCertificate request.

        <li>Volume is preserved</li>
        <li class="correct">Instance runs on a new host computer</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="more-info">An instance reboot is equivalent to an operating system reboot. In most cases, it takes only a few minutes to reboot your instance. When you reboot an instance, it remains on the same physical host, so your instance keeps its public DNS name (IPv4), private IPv4 address, IPv6 address (if applicable), and any data on its instance store volumes.</p>

  <p>A user is using a small MySQL RDS DB. The user is experiencing high latency due to the Multi AZ feature. Which of the below mentioned options may not help the user in this situation?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Schedule the automated backup in non-working hours</li>
    <li>Use a larger size instance</li>
    <li>Use PIOPS</li>
    <li>Take a snapshot from standby replica</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="more-info">In a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The primary DB instance is synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to a standby replica to provide data redundancy, eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency spikes during system backups
    As per AWS the below are the best practices for multiAZ
    For production workloads, we recommend you use Provisioned IOPS and DB instance classes (m1.large and larger) that are optimized for Provisioned IOPS for fast, consistent performance. Hence option B and C are valid.
    Also if backups are scheduled during working hours , then I/O can be suspended and increase the latency of the DB, hence it is better to schedule outside of office hours.</p>

  <p>A user has setup an EBS backed instance and a CloudWatch alarm when the CPU utilization is more than 65%. The user has setup the alarm to watch it for 5 periods of 5 minutes each. The CPU utilization is 60% between 9 AM to 6 PM. The user has stopped the EC2 instance for 15 minutes between 11 AM to 11:15 AM. What will be the status of the alarm at 11:30 AM?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Alarm Incorrect</li>
    <li class="correct">OK</li>
    <li>Insufficient Data</li>
    <li>Error</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="more-info">Since the alarm has been set for 5 periods of 5 minutes each, that means if there is no activity for 25 minutes then the state of the Alarm will change. Now since the CPU utilization was 60%, that means the alarm was not triggered and the state should be OK. And since the instance was just stopped for 15 minutes and did not exceed the threshold for 25 minutes that means the state of the alarm stays the same.</p>
