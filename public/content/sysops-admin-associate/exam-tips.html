    <p>A user has created a web application with auto scaling. The user is regularly monitoring the application and observed that the traffic is highest on Thursday and Friday between 8am-6pm. What is the best solution to handle scaling in this case?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a new instance manually by 8am Thursday and terminate it by 6pm Friday</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="more-info">To configure ASG to scale based on a schedule, you create a scheduled action, which tells Auto Scaling to perform a scaling action at specified times. To create a scaling action, you specify the start time when you want the scaling action to take effect, and the new minimum, maximum and desired sizes for the scaling action. At the specified time, the Auto Scaling updates the group with the values for min/max/desired specified by the scaling action.</p>
