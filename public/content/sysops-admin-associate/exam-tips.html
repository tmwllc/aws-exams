<div class="question">
    <p>A user has created a web application with auto scaling. The user is regularly monitoring the application and observed that the traffic is highest on Thursday and Friday between 8am-6pm. What is the best solution to handle scaling in this case?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a new instance manually by 8am Thursday and terminate it by 6pm Friday</li>
        <li class="correct">Schedule auto scaling to scale up by 8am Thursday and scale down after 6pm Friday</li>
        <li>Schedule a policy which may scale up every day at 8am and scales down by 6pm</li>
        <li>Configure a batch process to add an instance by 8am and remote by Friday 6pm</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="more-info">To configure ASG to scale based on a schedule, you create a scheduled action, which tells Auto Scaling to perform a scaling action at specified times. To create a scaling action, you specify the start time when you want the scaling action to take effect, and the new minimum, maximum and desired sizes for the scaling action. At the specified time, the Auto Scaling updates the group with the values for min/max/desired specified by the scaling action.</p>

    <p>A system admin is maintaining an application on AWS. The app is installed on EC2 and user has configured ELB and auto scaling. Considering future load increase, the user is planning to launch new servers proactively so that they get registered with the ELB. How can the user add these instances with auto scaling?</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="correct">Increase the desired capacity of the auto scaling group</li>

    <p>You have an Auto Scaling group associated with an ELB. You have noticed that instances launched via the Auto Scaling group are being marked unhealthy due to an ELB health check, but these unhealthy instances are not being terminated. What do you need to do to ensure trial instances marked unhealthy by the ELB will be terminated and replaced?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change the thresholds set on the Auto Scaling group health check</li>
        <li class="correct">Add an Elastic Load Balancing health check to your Auto Scaling group</li>
