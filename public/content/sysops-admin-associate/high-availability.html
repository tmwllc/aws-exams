<h1>High Availability Exam Tips</h1>
<h2>Elasticity</h2>
<p>Think of elasticity as a rubber band. It allows you to stretch out and retract back your infrastructure, based on demand. Only pay for what you need. Elasticity is used during a short time period, such as hours or days.</p>
<h2>Scalability</h2>
<p>Used to talk about building out the infrastructure to meet your long term needs. Scalability is used over longer time periods, such as weeks, days, months, and years.</p>

<h3>Scalability vs Elasticity in AWS Services</h3>
<ul>
    <li>EC2
        <ul>
            <li>Scalability - Increase instance sizes as require, using reserved instances</li>
            <li>Elasticity - Increase number of EC2 instances, based on autoscaling</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>Scalability - </li>
            <li>Elasticity - </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>DynamoDB
        <ul>
            <li>Scalability - Unlimited storage</li>
            <li>Elasticity - Increase IOPS for additional traffic. Decrease afterward. DynamoDB now has autoscaling for this.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>RDS
        <ul>
            <li>Scalability - Increase instance size</li>
            <li>Elasticity - Not very elastic, can't scale RDS based on demand</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
