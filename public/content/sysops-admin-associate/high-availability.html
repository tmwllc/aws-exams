<h1>High Availability Exam Tips</h1>
<h2>Elasticity</h2>
<p>Think of elasticity as a rubber band. It allows you to stretch out and retract back your infrastructure, based on demand. Only pay for what you need. Elasticity is used during a short time period, such as hours or days.</p>
<h2>Scalability</h2>
<p>Used to talk about building out the infrastructure to meet your long term needs. Scalability is used over longer time periods, such as weeks, days, months, and years.</p>

<h3>Scalability vs Elasticity in AWS Services</h3>
<ul>
    <li>EC2
        <ul>
            <li>Scalability - Increase instance sizes as require, using reserved instances</li>
            <li>Elasticity - Increase number of EC2 instances, based on autoscaling</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>Scalability - </li>
            <li>Elasticity - </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>DynamoDB
        <ul>
            <li>Scalability - Unlimited storage</li>
            <li>Elasticity - Increase IOPS for additional traffic. Decrease afterward. DynamoDB now has autoscaling for this.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>RDS
        <ul>
            <li>Scalability - Increase instance size</li>
            <li>Elasticity - Not very elastic, can't scale RDS based on demand</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>RDS</h3>
<p>Can scale up, switch to Multi-AZ, enable backups without altering the DNS name of the instance. However, restoring from a backup/snapshot will always create a new DB with new DNS name. Scaling up will result in some downtime, though, so should be done during off hours, or restore from a backup and switch the app to point to the new DNS name. </p>
<p>Cannot have multiple AZs enabled on Read Replicas. You can have multiple Read Replicas in different AZs, though.</p>
<p>If you want to force a failover from primary DB to secondary DB in different AZ, reboot the primary. You'll see option for "reboot with failover". Select that and click ok.</p>

<h3>Bastion Hosts</h3>
<p>For high availability, setup 2+ bastion hosts in different AZs/Subnets. Use Route53 Failover routing to send traffic to primary/secondary Bastion host.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting Autoscaling</h3>
<p>Things to look for if instances are not launching into ASG</p>
<ul>
    <li>Associated Key Pair does not exist</li>
    <li>SG does not exist</li>
    <li>Autoscaling config is not working correctly</li>
    <li>Autoscaling group not found</li>
    <li>Instance type specified is not supported in the AZ</li>
    <li>AZ is no longer supported</li>
    <li>Invalid EBS device mapping</li>
    <li>Autoscaling service is not enabled on account</li>
    <li>Attempting to attach an EBS block device to an instance-store AMI</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
