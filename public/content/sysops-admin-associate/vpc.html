<h1>VPC Tips</h1>

<p>When creating a new VPC, a security group, route and ACL are created automatically. However, it does not create subnets or internet gateway.</p>

<p>VPC is a logical datacenter. Do not span regions, but can span availability zones. Can have a maximum of 5 VPCs in each AWS region by default Consists of Internet Gateways (IGWs) or Virtual Private Gateways, Route Tables, Access Control Lists, Subnets, Security Groups. 1 subnet = 1 availability zone (they cannot span multiple AZs) - this comes up a lot on exams</p>

<p>It is a logically isolated section of AWS where you can AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over virtual networking env, including selection of your IP address range, creation of subnets, configuration of route tables and network gateways.</p>

<p>Can create public facing subnet for web servers that has access to Internet, and place backend systems such as DBs or app servers in private facing subnet with no Internet access. Can leverage mutlple layers of security, including security group and network access control lists, to helpl control access to EC2 instances in each subnet.</p>

<p>Can create Hardware VPN connection between your corporate datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS cloud as an extension of corporate datacenter.</p>

<p>Subnets can be public or private. They will have different address ranges. Example: public 10.0.1.0/24, private 10.0.2.0/24. A public subnet is one that has at least one route in routing table that uses an internet gateway.</p>

<p>Security groups and Access Control Lists (ACLs) can span subnets.</p>

<p>Can only have one internet gateway per VPC. Common question would be "in order to increase network speed, can you attach additional IGWs?". No, you cannot.</p>

<p>Security groups are stateful. If you create a rule allowing HTTP into security group, by default HTTP is allowed out as well.</p>

<p>ACLs however are stateless. If  you create a rule allowing HTTP in, you have to create the rule allowing HTTP out as well.</p>

<h3>Default VPC:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Is user friendly, allowing you to immediately deploy instances.</li>
  <li>Is created by default when AWS account is created.</li>
  <li>All subnets in default VPC have a route out to the Internet. They are all public.</li>
  <li>Each EC2 instance within default VPC will have public and private IP.</li>
  <li>If deleted, the only way to get it back is to contact AWS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>VPC Peering:</h3>
<p>Allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses (rather than going out through the Internet). Instances behave as if they're on the same private network. Can peer VPCs with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPCs in the same account. Always done in a star configuration, i.e. 1 central VPC peers with 4 others. No transitive peering! No transitive peering means that if you have 5 VPCs (A-E), with B-E all peered to A, that means that B-E are not peered to each other even though they are all peered to A. You would need to peer them individually to each other if desired.</p>

<h3>Creating:</h3>
<p>When creating a VPC manually via the console, it will automatically create security groups, ACLs and route tables. It does not create a subnet or internet gateway.</p>

<p>When creating a subnet, 3 IPs are reserved by default. Does not count .0 or .255 IPs. They are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>.1 - VPC router</li>
  <li>.2 - DNS Server</li>
  <li>.3 - Reserved for future use</li>
</ul>
<p>.0 and .255 cannot be addressed, so they are not counted as reserved by AWS, but still cannot be used.</p>

<p>When creating a new subnet, it will always be associated with your main route table. For that reason, you should not have a route out to the Internet on the main route table, because every subnet you create by default will have Internet access.</p>

<h3>NAT:</h3>
<h4>NAT Instances:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>When creating you must disable source/destination check on the NAT instance.</li>
  <li>Must be in a public subnet</li>
  <li>Must be a route out of private subnet to the NAT instance in order for it to work</li>
  <li>Must have a public IP.</li>
  <li>Amount of traffic that instance supports depends on instance size. If it's bottlenecking, increase instance size.</li>
  <li>Can create high availability using autoscaling groups, multiple subnets in different AZs and a script to automate failover</li>
  <li>Always behind a security group</li>
  <li>Have to be patched to keep up with security updates</li>
</ul>

<h4>NAT Gateways:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>New, may not be in exam yet</li>
  <li>Much easier to setup and maintain than NAT instances (though may cost a bit more)</li>
  <li>Preferred by the enterprise</li>
  <li>Scale up to 10Gbps automatically</li>
  <li>No need to patch</li>
  <li>Not associated with security groups</li>
  <li>Automatically assigned a public IP</li>
  <li>Need to update your route table to point to NAT Gateway</li>
  <li>No need to disable source/destination check</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bastions:</h3>
<p>Used to securely administer EC2 instances (using SSH or RDP) in private subnets. Also called jump boxes or jump servers. SSH into bastion, and from there you can SSH into server in private subnet.</p>
<p>Put them behind an autoscaling group with a minimum size of 2. Use Route53 to automatically fail over.</p>

<h3>NATs:</h3>
<p>Used to provide internet access to EC2 instances that are within private subnets.</p>

<h3>ACLs and Security Groups</h3>
<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Security.html#VPC_Security_Comparison" target="_blank">Comparison of Security Groups and Network ACLs</a></p>

<h4>Security Groups:</h4>
<p>Security groups are first line of defense and are at the instance level. Everything is denied by default, white list allows various protocols and IPs through. Stateful, when opening up inbound traffic, outbound is automatically allowed as well. Instances must be manually put into a security group.</p>

<h4>ACLs:</h4>
<p>ACLs are second line of defense and are at the subnet level. Allows both allow/deny rules so you can allow SSH, but block it from various IPs. Stateless, when opening up inbound traffic, outbound is not automatically allowed. Must be manually added. Automatically applied to all instances in the subnet. No need to add to each instance within the subnet. Rules are applied in numerical order. Lower numbered rules will trump higher numbered rules. When creating a VPC, an ACL is automatically created which allows all inbound/outbound traffic. But when creating an ACL, it will block all inbound/outbound traffic by default. ACLs can be associated with multiple subnets, however a subnet can only be associated with one ACL. If you associate an ACL with a subnet that already is associated to another ACL, the previous association is removed. If you don't associate a subnet with an ACL, it automatically gets associated with default ACL.</p>

<p>To block specific IPs from a network, you can only use an ACL. Security groups do not have this option.</p>

<h3>Load Balancers:</h3>
<p>If you want your servers to be highly available, you always want at least 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets so that you can use a load balancer to send traffic to each. Make sure each subnet is in a different availability zone.</p>

<p>When creating subnets within a VPC in different availability zones, by default they can still communicate with each other.</p>

<h3>Steps to create a VPC with public/private subnets, public web server, private SQL server:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create VPC with CIDR range 10.0.0.0/16</li>
  <li>Create Private Subnet with IP range 10.0.0.0/24 in AZ 1</li>
  <li>Create Public Subnet with IP range 10.0.1.0/24 in AZ 2</li>
  <li>Subnet Actions - Modify auto-assign IP settings -> Enable to auto create public IP for instances created in Public subnet</li>
  <li>Create Internet Gateway and attach it to VPC</li>
  <li>Create Route Table, with rule giving 0.0.0.0 a route to the internet using the Internet Gateway</li>
  <li>Associate Route with public subnet</li>
  <li>Create Security Group which gives HTTP, HTTPS and SSH access to 0.0.0.0/0, which will be used for public subnet EC2 instances.</li>
  <li>Create EC2 instance in public subnet with bootstrap script to install/start Apache and create simple webpage</li>
  <li>Attempt to load webpage in browser</li>
  <li>Create EC2 in private subnet with new security group that gives SSH access to 10.0.0.0/24.</li>
  <li>Remote into public instance. Copy key into new text file on public instance.</li>
  <li>chmod key with 400 (do this with sudo)</li>
  <li>SSH into private instance from public instance using private IP</li>
  <li>Create NAT Gateway in public subnet, use Create New IP button to give it an IP</li>
  <li>Open default route table and add a route for 0.0.0.0/0 and give target of our NAT Gateway</li>
  <li>Create new ACL and associate it with public subnet.</li>
  <li>Add ACL rules to allow traffic for HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH from 0.0.0.0/0 (make sure to add same rules for outbound)</li>
  <li>Add ephemeral ports rule using Custom TCP in ACL with port range 1024-65536 (again, outbound as well)</li>
</ol>

<p>When using VPC wizard, there are 4 options for creating a VPC:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single Public Subnet</li>
  <li>Public and Private Subnets</li>
  <li>Public and Private Subnets and Hardware VPN Access</li>
  <li>Private Subnet with Hardware VPN Access</li>
</ul>
<p>When setting up EC2 instances (db and app) in a VPC in different subnets, you must setup an ACL that allows communication between the two and ensure SGs are set to allow the app host to talk to the db on the right port/protocol.</p>
