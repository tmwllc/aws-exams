<h1>ELB Monitoring Exam Tips</h1>
<p>ELB only reports when requests are flowing. If no traffic, no data points are recorded. Records in 60 second intervals.</p>
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<ul>
    <li>HealthyHostCount - # of healthy hosts in each AZ</li>
    <li>UnHealthyHostcount - # of unhealthy hosts in each AZ</li>
    <li>Requestcount - # of completed requests received and routed to back end instances</li>
    <li>Latency - Time in seconds after request leaves LB until response is received</li>
    <li>HTTpCode_ELB_4XX - # of Http 4xx error codes generated by ELB when listener is configured to use HTTP/HTTPS protocols</li>
    <li>HTTPCode_ELB_5XX - # of Http 5xx error codes generated by ELB when listener is configured to use HTTP/HTTPS protocols</li>
    <li>HTTPCode_BackEnd_2XX (or 3XX/4XX/5XX) - # of HTTP response codes generated by back-end instances. Does not include responses given by the ELB.</li>
    <li>BackEndConnectionErrors - # of connections that were not successfully established between ELB and instances. Because ELB will retry when there are errors, this can exceed the request rate.</li>
    <li>SurgeQueueLength - # of requests that are pending submission to an instance. When EC2 instances are too busy to handle requests, this queue will build up. Good idea to build Autoscaling based on SurgeQueueLength.</li>
    <li>SpilloverCount - # of requests rejected to queue being full. Can alternatively set AutoScaling based on this, but this will result in some requests being dropped before it scales.</li>
</ul>
