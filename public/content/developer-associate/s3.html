<h1>S3 Tips</h1>

<p>Data is spread across multiple devices and multiple facilities, which ensures data reliability.</p>

<p>Typical link to bucket: http://s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bucketName</p>

<ul>
  <li>0 bytes to 5TB size limit.</li>
  <li>Unlimited storage.</li>
  <li>Files stored in buckets (like a folder/directory)</li>
  <li>Bucket names are universal, so must be unique across all global users.</li>
</ul>

<p>Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects. Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES. New objects are immediately readable. But, if you update/delete an object, it can take time to propagate.</p>

<p>Max file size that can be uploaded with PUT operation is 5GB. For files larger than 5GB use multi-part upload API.</p>

<p>S3 is a key/value store and is object based:</p>
<ul>
  <li>key (name of object)</li>
  <li>value (data, sequence of bytes)</li>
  <li>version id (for versioning)</li>
  <li>metadata (data about the data being stored)</li>
  <li>subresources (not relevant to course)</li>
  <li>access control lists</li>
</ul>

<p>99.99% availability. 99.999999999% durability (11 x 9s). Can withstand the loss of 2 facilities concurrently and still have access to data.</p>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>tiered storage available</li>
  <li>lifecycle management</li>
  <li>versioning (allows reverting to previous version, or restoring in case of delete)</li>
  <li>encryption (AES 256)</li>
  <li>secure data using access control list and/or bucket policies</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>S3 - normal 99.99% available</li>
  <li>S3 - IA (infrequently accessed) data is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access (unlike Glacier). Costs less than standard S3, but charges a retrieval fee.</li>
  <li>RRS - Reduced Redundancy Storage - 99.99% durability/availability. Data that can be recreated, like thumbnails. Cheaper than regular S3.</li>
  <li>Glacier - 3-5 hours to restore an object. Used for archival. Cheapest of all storage types.</li>
</ul>

<p>Charged for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Storage (more storage is cheaper)</li>
  <li>Requests</li>
</ul>

<p>S3 Bucket link vs S3 Website link:</p>
<ul>
  <li>http://tw-cloudguru-website.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com (website, always http)</li>
  <li>http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bucket-name</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enable CORS in S3</h3>
<p>Add CORS.xml file to hosting bucket, configure the AllowedOrigin node to point to desired domain which should be able to access files in this bucket.</p>

<h3>Versioning</h3>
<p>Versioning can only be turned on, never turned off. It can be suspended, but not turned off. To restore a deleted file when versioning is on, show versions, then delete the "delete marker". Versioning allows MFA delete capability. So users must authenticate with separate provider in order to delete.</p>

<h3>Lifecycle</h3>
<p>Lifecycle can be used with/without versioning. Can be applied to current and previous versions.</p>
<p>Following actions can be done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transition to standard infrequent access (128kb and 30 day minimum wait)</li>
  <li>Archive to glacier (30 days after archive to Infrequent)</li>
  <li>Permanently delete (if versioning is on, this just puts a delete marker on it, doesn't actually delete it)</li>
  <li>Cannot move objects to Reduced Redundancy Storage via lifecycle.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transfer Acceleration</h3>
<p>Uses CloudFront edge network to accelerate S3 uploads. Uses distinct url to upload to an edge location (ideally one closer to you). This will incur an additional fee (per upload).</p>

<p>Can use pre-signed URL to share S3 bucket with someone. If a website is using your S3 images without permission, a possible solution is to remove public access and use signed URLs with expiry dates.</p>
