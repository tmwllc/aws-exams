<h1>EBS, EC2 and ELB Tips</h1>

To enable encryption at rest (?) on EC2, need to configure encryption when creating the EBS volume.

EC2 instance types:
T - cheap
D - density
R - RAM
G - graphics
I - IOPS (input/output operations per second)
M - main choice for general purpose
t2 - low cost, general purpose. used for web servers, small dbs.
m4 - general purpose. used for app servers.
m3 - general purpose, used for app servers.
c4 - compute optimized, cpu intensive apps/dbs.
c3 - compute optimized, cpu intensive apps/dbs.
r3 - memory optimized, memory intensive apps/dbs
g2 - graphics/general purpose gpu. video encoding, machine learning, 3d app streaming
i2 - high speed storage, nosql dbs, data warehousing
d2 - dense storage. used for file servers, data warehousing, hadoop
EC2 Instances:
On Demand (paid by hour, no contract)
Spot (bid price, if price is at/below bid, instance comes up, if price rises, instance terminated). If you terminate, you pay for partial hour. If AWS terminates, you don't pay for partial hour.
Reserved (1-3 year contract, cheaper price due to contract)
Reserved instances can be moved from one availability zone to another.

To find public/private IP of EC2 instance, ssh into box and run: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/.

EBS Storage:
General purpose SSD (GP2) (up to 10,000 IOPS)
Provisioned IOPS SSD (I01) (more than 10,000 IOPS)
Magnetic - cheap, infrequently accessed storage
Cannot mount an EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances. Think of volumes as a hard drive, can't connect it to multiple computers. If you need shared storage, use EFS (block level) or S3 (flat files).

EBS backed instances can be stopped and restarted, unlike instance-store backed instances.

ELBs are charged by the hour and per GB.
Free Services: CloudFormation, Elastic Beanstalk, Autoscaling, Opsworks (but resources they provision are not free).

ELB supported protocols: http, https, tcp, ssl.
ELP supported ports: EC2-VPC: 1-65535

SDKs: https://aws.amazon.com/tools/
Android, iOS, JavaScript
Java
.Net
NodeJs
PHP
Python
Ruby
Go
C++ (in developer preview?)
SDK Default region: Us-east-1
Some sdks have default regions (java) others don't (nodejs)
