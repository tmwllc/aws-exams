<h1>SWF Tips</h1>

Worker:
Interact with SWF to get tasks, process received tasks and returns the results.

Decider:
Controls the coordination of tasks, i.e., their ordering, concurrency and scheduling according to the application logic.

SWF brokers the workflow between workers and deciders. It assures that a task is assigned only once and is never duplicated. Because SWF maintains application's state durably, workers and deciders don't have to keep track of execution state.

With SQS, tasks can be assigned multiple times and can be duplicated and may be performed twice.

Domains:
Isolate a set of types, executions and task lists from orders with the same accoun. Can register a domain by using AWS console or by using the RegisterDomain action in SWF API. Parameters are specified in JSON.

Maximum workflow is 1 year and value is always measured in seconds.

SWF vs SQS:
SWF presents a task oriented API, whereas SQS offers a message oriented API.
SWF tasks are assigned only once and never duplicated. SQS requires handling of duplicagted messages and may also need to ensure a message is processed only once.
SWF keeps track of all tasks and events in application. With SQS you need to implement your own app level tracking, especially if app uses multiple queues.
Test may ask when its appropriate to use SWF or SQS. If it involves human interaction, use SWF.If it mentions domains, workers or deciders, it's talking about SWF.
