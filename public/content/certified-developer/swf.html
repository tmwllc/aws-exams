<h1>SWF Tips</h1>

<h3>Worker:</h3>
<p>Interact with SWF to get tasks, process received tasks and returns the results.</p>

<h3>Decider:</h3>
<p>Controls the coordination of tasks, i.e., their ordering, concurrency and scheduling according to the application logic.</p>

<h3>Domains:
<p>Isolate a set of types, executions and task lists from orders with the same accoun. Can register a domain by using AWS console or by using the RegisterDomain action in SWF API. Parameters are specified in JSON.</p>

<p>SWF brokers the workflow between workers and deciders. It assures that a task is assigned only once and is never duplicated. Because SWF maintains application's state durably, workers and deciders don't have to keep track of execution state.</p>

<p>With SQS, tasks can be assigned multiple times and can be duplicated and may be performed twice. Maximum workflow is 1 year and value is always measured in seconds.</p>

<h3>SWF vs SQS:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>SWF presents a task oriented API, whereas SQS offers a message oriented API.</li>
  <li>SWF tasks are assigned only once and never duplicated. SQS requires handling of duplicated messages and may also need to ensure a message is processed only once.</li>
  <li>SWF keeps track of all tasks and events in application. With SQS you need to implement your own app level tracking, especially if app uses multiple queues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Test may ask when its appropriate to use SWF or SQS. If it involves human interaction, use SWF. If it mentions domains, workers or deciders, it's talking about SWF.</p>
