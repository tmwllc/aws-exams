<ul>
  <li>Application Load Balancer - newer, introduced in mid 2016, not featured on tests yet</li>
  <li>Classic Load Balancer</li>

<ul>
  <li>Never have IP addresses, only DNS names, which point to a dynamic IP</li>
  <li>Instances monitored by ELBs will be reported as InService or OutofService</li>
  <li>Health checks check health by talking to, looking for a specific endpoint and whether the response is 200 (or some other specified value from 200-299)</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, load balancers distribute requests evenly across its enabled AZs. So if you have 10 instances in AZ A, and 2 instances in AZ B, the 2 instances in AZ B serve the same number of requests as the 10 in AZ A. To spread the traffic evenly across all instances, enable cross zone load balancing.</p>
