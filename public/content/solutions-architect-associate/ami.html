<h3>Amazon Machine Image (AMI) Tips</h3>

<p>Provides info required to launch a virtual server in the cloud.</p>

<p>AMIs are regional. You can only launch an AMI from the region in which it is stored. However, AMIs can easily be copied to other regions using the console, command line or EC2 API.</p>

<h4>Components</h4>
<ul>
	<li>A template for the root volume of the instance. For example an OS, an app server and applications.</li>
	<li>Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.</li>
	<li>A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Disable services and protocols that authenticate users in clear text (e.g. Telnet and FTP).</li>
	<li>Do not start unnecessary network services on launch. Only administrative services (SSH/RDP) and the services required for your application should be started.</li>
	<li>Securely delete all AWS credentials from disk and configuration files.</li>
	<li>Securely delete any third-party credentials from disk and configuration files.</li>
	<li>Securely delete any additional certificates or key material from the system.</li>
	<li>Ensure that software installed on your AMI does not have default internal accounts and passwords (e.g. database servers with a default admin username and password).</li>
	<li>Ensure that the system does not violate the Amazon Web Services Acceptable Use Policy. Examples include open SMTP relays or proxy servers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Should also delete bash history so that users can't hit up arrow at command line and run previous commands. Command to delete history is "history -c".</p>
