<h1>RAID, Volumes and Snapshots</h1>
<h3>RAID Types</h3>
<ul>
	<li>RAID 0: striped, no redundancy, good performance</li>
	<li>RAID 1: mirroed, redundancy</li>
	<li>RAID 5: 3+ drives, good for reads, bad for writes. AWS strongly recommends not using RAID 5 on EBS.</li>
	<li>RAID 10: Striped and mirrored, good redundancy, good performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>If exam gives an option for using RAID 5 as an answer, it's NOT the answer. RAID 10 is great for IO.</p>
