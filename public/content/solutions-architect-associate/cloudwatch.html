<h1>CloudWatch Tips</h1>

<p>Can only see metrics for CPU, Disk, Network and Status (not Memory).</p>

<p>When creating an EC2 instance, it gives option for detailed CloudWatch monitoring. By default this is off, and regular monitoring will happen every 5 minutes. Detailed monitoring will happen every minute, but costs more.</p>

<p>Can setup alarm thresholds to trigger alerts when metrics exceed a defined level. Alerts can be sent via email.</p>

<p>Events help you respond to state changes in your AWS resources. For example, automatically invoke a Lambda to update DNS when an event notifies you that EC2 instances enters the running state.</p>

<h3>Alarm Types</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Alarm</li>
  <li>Insufficient</li>
  <li>OK</li>
</ul>
<p>CloudWatch Logs can ingest, aggregate and monitor any text based common log data or JSON formatted logs.</p>

<p>To check free memory on a DB instance, look at Freeable Memory metric.</p>

<h3>Retention Periods</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 minute datapoints: 15 days</li>
