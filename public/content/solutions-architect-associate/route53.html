<h1>Route 53 Tips</h1>
<ul>
  <li>ELBs do not have pre-defined IPv4 addresses, you resolve them using a DNS name.</li>
  <li>Understand the difference between an Alias Record and a CNAME.
    <ul>
      <li>Alias records allow you to resolve a naked domain name to an ELB's DNS address.</li>
      <li>When making a request to Route 53 for a DNS record, you will be charged for that request if using CNAME. But you will not be charged if using Alias Record.</li>
      <li>Most of the time you should be using an Alias record.</li>
    </ul>
