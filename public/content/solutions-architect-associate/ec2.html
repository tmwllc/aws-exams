<h1>EC2 Tips</h1>

<ul>
  <li>On Demand
    <ul>
      <li>Users that want the low cost and flexibility of EC2 without up front payment or long term commitment.</li>
      <li>Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that can't be interrupted.</li>
      <li>Apps being develped or tested on EC2 for the first time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reserved
    <ul>
      <li>Apps with staedy state or predictable usage</li>
      <li>Apps that require reserved capacity</li>
      <li>Users are able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Spot
    <ul>
      <li>Apps that flexible start/end times</li>
      <li>Apps that are only feasible at very low compute prices</li>
      <li>Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dedicated Hosts
    <ul>
      <li>Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization</li>
      <li>Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments</li>
      <li>Can be purchased on demand (hourly)</li>
      <li>Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If spot instances are terminated by Amazon due to price change, you will not be charged for that hour. However, if you terminate it, you will be charged for that hour.</p>

<p>EC2 instance levels:</p>
<ul>
  <li>T - cheap</li>
  <li>D - density</li>
  <li>F - Field Programmable Gate Array</li>
  <li>R - RAM</li>
  <li>G - graphics</li>
  <li>C - compute</li>
  <li>I - IOPS (input/output operations per second)</li>
  <li>M - main choice for general purpose</li>
  <li>X - eXtreme memory</li>
  <li>P - graphics (think pics)</li>
</ul>

<p>Instance types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>t2 - low cost, general purpose. used for web servers, small dbs.</li>
  <li>m4 - general purpose. used for app servers.</li>
  <li>m3 - general purpose, used for app servers.</li>
  <li>c4 - compute optimized, cpu intensive apps/dbs.</li>
  <li>c3 - compute optimized, cpu intensive apps/dbs.</li>
  <li>r3 - memory optimized, memory intensive apps/dbs</li>
  <li>g2 - graphics/general purpose gpu. video encoding, machine learning, 3d app streaming</li>
  <li>i2 - high speed storage, nosql dbs, data warehousing</li>
  <li>f1 - field programmable gate array. hardware acceleration for your code. Can change underlying hardware to suit your code.</li>
  <li>d2 - dense storage. used for file servers, data warehousing, hadoop</li>
  <li>p2 - graphics and general purpose. machine learning, bit coin mining</li>
  <li>x1 - memory optimized. For SAP HANA/Apache Spark, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Status Checks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>System Status Check - checks network connectivity, verifies that AWS is able to get network packets to the instance. Does not validate that the OS and applications are accepting traffic.</li>
  <li>Instance Status Check - ensures that instance OS is accepting traffic.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Volume Encryption</h3>
<p>When provisioning an instance, you can add additional volumes. These will give the option to be encrypted. But the Root volume will not give this option. Root volume can be encrypted, but you must provision them first, create an AMI of that instance, and while copying that encrypt the root device volume.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Termination proectection is turned off by default. If turned on, the instance cannot be terminated from the console without first disabling termination protection.</li>
  <li>On an EBS backed instance, the default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when instance is terminated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Volumes and Snapshots</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Volumes exist on EBS and are like a virtual hard disk. Can not be attached to multiple instances.</li>
  <li>Snapshots exist on S3
    <ul>
      <li>Can take a snapshot of a volume and store it on S3</li>
      <li>Snapshots are point in time copies of volumes.</li>
      <li>Snapshots are incremental, this means that only the blocks that have changed since last snapshot are moved to S3.</li>
      <li>If this is you first snapshot, it mayuu take some time to create.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When taking a snapshot of an EBS volume that serves as root, you should first stop the instance. If you don't, AWS will stop it automatically before taking the snapshot.</p>

<h3>Elastic Load Balancers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Never have a static IP address, only a DNS name which resolve to a dynamic IP.</li>
</ul>
