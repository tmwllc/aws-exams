<h1>RAID Snapshots</h1>

<p>When taking a snapshot, it excludes all data held in cache by applications and the OS. This is fine for a single volume, but with RAID arrays it is an issue. We need to take an application consistent snapshot by stopping the app from writing to disk and flushing all caches. This can be done in 3 ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Freeze the file system</li>
  <li>Unmount the RAID array</li>
  <li>Shut down the EC2 instance associated with volumes (easiest and most common route)</li>
</ul>
