<h1>SQS Exam Tips</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Pull based, not pushed based</li>
    <li>Messages are 256kb in size</li>
    <li>Standard Queues and FIFO queues. FIFO queues are new and guarantee messages are processed in same order they are sent. Standard queues can come out of order.</li>
    <li>Messages can be kept in queue from 1 minute to 14 days, default is 4 days</li>
    <li>Visibility Time Out is the amount of time that the message is invisible in the SQS queue after a reader picks up that message</li>
    <li>Provided the job is processed before the visibility timeout expires, the message will then be deleted from the queue</li>
    <li>If the job is not processed within that time, the message will become visible again and another reader will process it. This could result in same message being delivered twice.</li>
    <li>Because messages can be delivered twice, it's important to make processing of them idempotent.</li>
    <li>Visibility Timeout maximum is 12 hours.</li>
    <li>SQS Long Polling is a way to retrieve messages from SQS queues. While regular polling returns immediately, even if the message queue is empty. Long polling doesn't return a response until a message arrives in the queue, or the long poll times out.</li>
    <li>Retention can be set to between 1 minute and 14 days</li>
