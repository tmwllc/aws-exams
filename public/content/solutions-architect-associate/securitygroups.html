<h1>Security Groups Tips</h1>

<ul>
	<li>All inbound traffic is blocked by default.</li>
	<li>All outbound traffic is allowed by default.</li>
	<li>Changes to security groups take effect immediately.</li>
	<li>You can have unlimited EC2 instances within a security group.</li>
	<li>You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instances.</li>
	<li>Security groups are stateful: when creating inbound traffic rules, the same is automatically allowed for outbound.</li>
	<li>You cannot block specific IPs with Security Groups. You must use Access Control Lists for that.</li>
