<h3>Identity Access Management (IAM) Tips</h3>

<p>New users are given a username/password as well as an access key id and secret access key. The username/password can only be used to login to the console, not for use with the CLI. The opposite is true of access key id and secret access key.</p>

<p>Federated users are users managed outside of AWS in your corporate directory.</p>

<h4>Permission Types</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Resource based</li>
  <li>User based</li>
</ul>

<p>It's always best to setup roles for permissions, even briefly needed ones. For example, a user needs to modify configuration of an ELB one time only. You should create an IAM role and attach a policy allowing modification access to the ELB.</p>
