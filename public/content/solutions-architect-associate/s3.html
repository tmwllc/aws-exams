<h1>S3 Tips</h1>

<p>Bucket limit is 100 by default, but can request to increase limit by visiting AWS Service Limits.</P>

<h2><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/" target="_blank">S3 FAQ</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>99.99% availability</li>
  <li>99.999999999% durability (11 x 9s)</li>
  <li>Tiered storage available (standard, infrequent access, glacier)</li>
  <li>Lifecycle management to move files to lower tiers or delete based on age of file.</li>
  <li>Versioning</li>
  <li>Encryption</li>
  <li>Secure with ACLs or bucket policies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Charges:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Storage</li>
  <li>Requests</li>
  <li>Storage Management Pricing - allows you to associate data with different teams/departments so you can see which team is costing what.</li>
  <li>Data transfer pricing (moving around within S3)</li>
  <li>Transfer Acceleration - enables fast transfers between users and a bucket. Uses CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. Data arrives at an edge location, it is routed to S3 over an optimized network path for fastest transfer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tiers:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Standard - 99.99% available, 99.999999999% durability, stored across multiple devices in multiple facilities, designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.</li>
  <li>Infrequently Accessed - For data accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. lower fee than standard, but you are charged a retrieval fee.</li>
  <li>Reduced Redundancy - 99.99% durability and availability.</li>
  <li>Glacier - Very cheap, but for archival only. 3-5 hours to restore from Glacier.</li>
</ul>

<p>To increase performance when saving log files, add a random string to the start of the file name. This way they are not all grouped together alphabetically.</p>

<h3>Bucket URL Formats:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bucket: https://s3-REGION.amazonaws.com/BUCKETNAME</li>
  <li>Website: http://BUCKETNAME.s3-website-REGION.amazonaws.com</li>
</ul>

<h3>S3 Objects:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Key (filename)</li>
  <li>Value (the data, made up for a byte sequence)</li>
  <li>Version ID (used for versioning)</li>
  <li>Metadata (data about the data being stored)</li>
  <li>Subresources:
    <ul>
      <li>Access Control Lists (give fine grained permissios for an individual file</li>
      <li>Torrent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
  <li>By default all newly created buckets are private.</li>
  <li>Access Control
    <ul>
      <li>Bucket policies - apply to entire bucket</li>
      <li>Access Control Lists - can drill down to individual items within a bucket</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can be configured to create access logs which log all requests to the bucket. Can be logged to another bucket.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Encryption</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In transit: SSL/TLS</li>
  <li>At Rest:
    <ul>
      <li>Server Side Encryption
        <ul>
          <li>S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3. Each object encrypted with unique key. Additionally, the key itself is encrypted with a amaster key, which is regularly reotated.</li>
          <li>AWS Key Mangement Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS. Separate permissions for use of an envelope key. Envelope key is a key that protects the data's encryption key. Also provides audit trail of when keys were used and who used them. Can manage and encrypt keys yourself, or use default.</li>
          <li>Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys - SSE-C. Customer manages the encryption keys, Amazon manages the encryption/decryption.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Client Side Encryption
        <ul>
          <li>You encrypt data on client side and then upload it to S3.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Transfer Acceleration</h3>
<p>Utilises CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate your uploads to S3. Instead of uploading directly to S# bucket, you can use a distinct URL to upload directly to an edge location which will then transfer that file to S3. You will get a distinct URL to upload to, like: http://acloudguru.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com.</p>

<h3>Data Consistency</h3>
<ul>
  <li>PUTs: Read after write (available immediately after writing the file)</li>
  <li>Overwrite PUTs and DELETEs: Eventual consistency, usually within a second.</li>
  <li>Updates are atomic. When updating and immediately reading, you will either see old file or new file, never a partial file.</li>
</ul>
