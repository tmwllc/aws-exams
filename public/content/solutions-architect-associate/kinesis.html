<ul>
    <li>Max retention is 7 days, but default is 24 hours. Range is 1-7 days.</li>
    <li>Max size of data blob is 1MB</li>
    <li>Consumer - gets data records from Kinesis streams</li>
    <li>Producer - puts data records into Kinesis streams</li>
    <li>Streams - ingests a large amount of data in real time, durably stores the data, and makes the data available for consumption</li>
