<p>Lambda can automatically run code in response to modifications to objects in S3 buckets, messages arriving in Kinesis streams, or table updates in DynamoDB.</p>

<p>Runs your code on high availability compute infrastructure and performs all the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code and security patch deployment, and code monitoring and logging. All you need to do is supply the code.</p>
