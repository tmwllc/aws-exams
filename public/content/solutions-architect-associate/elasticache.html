<p>Service that makes it easy to deploy, operate and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk based databases.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Memcached - A widely adopted memory object caching system. ElastiCache is protocol compliant with MemcacheD, so popular tools that you use today with existing Memcached environments will work seamlessly with the service.</li>
    <li>Redis - A popular open-source in-memory key-value store that supports data structures such as sorted sets and lists. ElastiCache supports Master/Slave replication and multi-AZ which can be used to achieve cross AZ redundancy.</li>
