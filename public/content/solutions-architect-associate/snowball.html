<h3>Snowball Tips</h3>

<p>Old system was called Import/Export. Snowball replaces this. This allowed users to send in hard drives to Amazon, and they would transfer the data to AWS. This resulted in comoplexities with various kinds of external drives showing up, requiring different connection types. Snowball does away with this by standardizing to a Snowball appliance, which customers transfer data to, then send back to Amazon.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standard Snowball - Petabyte scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS.</li>
  <li>Snowball Edge - 100TB data transfer device with on-board storage and compute capabilities. You can use Snowball Edge to move large amounts of data into and out of AWS, as a temporary storage tier for largelocal datasets, or to support local workloads in remote or offline locations.</li>
  <li>Snowmobile - Exabyte scale data transfer service use to move extremelly large amounts of data to aWS.
